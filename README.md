An Attempt at a better Covid-19 case monitor for McQuaid Jesuit.

### How it Works

The PHP downloads data from NYS's case monitoring to parse every hour upon request.

## Archive

This project is being archived for two reasons:

1. No one is using it (because of its inaccessibility)
2. A better solution already exists

For the better, and by that I mean more up to date monitor, please visit [McQuaid's Website](https://mcquaid.org/covid-19/)
